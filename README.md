### Projects üêæ
- [METHODS OF CORPUS RESEARCH OF SOCIOLINGUISTIC VARIABILITY](https://github.com/dbadeev/gender_profiling) [on the example of the language of social networks] (Python) - Single and Cross-genre Gender Identification in Russian language
- [TWEETS](https://) (Python) - Intro to Natural Language Processing. Sentiment Analysis.
- [DSLR (Data Science X Logistic Regression)](https://) (Python) - Goals: Learn how to read a dataset, to visualize it in different ways, to select and clean unnecessary information from your data; Implement one-vs-all logistic regression w/o special Libraries using that will solve classification problem.
- [FT_LINEAR_REGRESSION](https://) (Python) - First of the projects in the machine learning area at 21 network. Objective is to create a linear regression function in the language of choise (python3) w/o special Libraries using, train the model on the given dataset, save generated indexes and use them to predict car price depending on it's mileage.
- [LIBFT](https://github.com/dbadeev/LIBFT) (C language) - Rewritten¬†library of C standard functions
- [FILLIT](https://github.com/dbadeev/fillit) (C language, group project) - Search for a square of the minimum size that can accommodate all issued tetramines  without intersections. Based on Knuth's Algorithm X using 'dancing links'.
- [PUSH SWAP](https://github.com/dbadeev/PUSH-SWAP) (C language) - Sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. Based on¬† original 'chunks' algorithm. 
- [LEM-IN](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50623941/135349368-7c5a1bb1-de58-4571-b185-3f0fa40d59ab.png) (C language, group project) - Finding the minimum node-disjoint paths and maximum flow from a source to destination in a nondirected graph. Based on Suurballe algorithm.
- [COMPUTOR v1](https://) (Python) - This project aims to make you code a simple equation solving program. It will take polynomial equations into account. These equations will only require exponents. No complex function. The program will have to display its solution(s).
